## Projects

### Analyzing selling price of used cars using Python
[Project Link](https://github.com/pallavisingh02/Projects/tree/main/Analyzing_selling_price_of_used_cars) - Python,ANOVA,Reg

-  Conducted a comprehensive analysis of used car selling prices using Python. This project involved cleaning and preparing the dataset, exploring relationships between various car features like engine size, horsepower, and fuel type with selling prices, and identifying significant factors influencing prices such as manufacturer, body style, and drive wheels. Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and advanced analytics techniques like regression and ANOVA, I uncovered valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.

### Retail Churn Analysis

[Project Link](https://github.com/pallavisingh02/Projects/tree/main/Online_Customer_Churn) - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), EDA, Statistics
- Conducted a thorough analysis of customer churn for a retail business, employing statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 1000 records.
- Addressed the critical issue of customer churn, mitigating significant costs and disruptions to organizations by actively identifying at-risk customers and implementing targeted retention strategies.
- Executed descriptive statistics, investigated churn rate 55.60% and characteristics, examined demographic and behavioral variables, utilized statistical tests (T-test, Z-test) to compare churners and non-churners, uncovering significant differences, performed correlation analysis, identifying strong predictors of churn.
### Targeted User Segmentation for Bicycle Project Funding
[Project Link](https://github.com/pallavisingh02/Projects/tree/main/Targeted_User_Segmentation) - Power BI, Power Query, DAX
- Developed a targeted push notification strategy to prompt user funding for a new 3-speed bicycle project, resulting in a 41% contribution rate from interested users.
- Tackled 9 critical questions through data analysis on a dataset of 50,000, yielding comprehensive and accurate answers.
- Created visualizations on demographic, behavioral, geographic, device usage, temporal, comparative, and correlational analysis.
- Identified key demographics, highlighting a 49% higher interest among the 18-24 age group and achieving a 59% engagement rate overall.
- Analyzed funding amounts by state, average funding for project by state, and participation rate by state.
Recognized priority regions for crowdfunding efforts and optimizing outreach campaigns based on peak funding hours.
- Examined device usage patterns (65% iOS), leading to effective resource allocation and increased engagement.
### Analysis for RiderRescue
[Project Link](https://github.com/pallavisingh02/Projects/tree/main/Analysis_For_RideRescue) - SQL, Power BI, EDA
- Investigated metrics for unsuccessful order completions in the GetTaxi application to enhance algorithm efficiency and improve ride assignments and customer satisfaction.
- Crafted SQL queries to analyze 10,717 datasets.
- Utilized SQL for analysis, uncovering insights into cancellation patterns, peak failure hours, average cancellation times, and correlations between order cancellations and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
- Identified prolonged wait times 71% before driver assignment as a key factor contributing to cancellations, emphasizing the need to reduce wait times to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
- Recognized consistent peak failure hours at 8:00, 21:00, and 23:00, suggesting targeted strategies during these times to improve service reliability and address cancellation issues.
