# Analyzing selling price of used cars using Python

This Python project aims to analyze the selling prices of used cars using a dataset. The analysis includes exploring relationships between various features of cars and their selling prices, identifying influential factors, and providing insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.

Dataset:
----------------------------------
The dataset contains information about used cars, including features like manufacturer, fuel type, engine size, horsepower, body style, drive wheels, and selling price.

Tools Used:
-----------------------------
- Python programming language
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy


## Steps:


Data Cleaning and Preparation:
-------------------------------
- Read the dataset and assigned column names.
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Converted data types and normalized values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-------------------------------
- Visualized the distribution of selling prices.
- Explored the variation in prices by manufacturer, fuel type, body style, and drive wheels.
- Investigated relationships between features like engine size, horsepower, and prices.
- Calculated correlation coefficients to understand feature relationships.

Regression Analysis:
-------------------------
-Conducted linear regression to analyze the relationship between engine size/horsepower and prices.
- Plotted regression lines for visualization.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):
---------------------------------------
- Performed ANOVA tests to compare mean prices across different categories like - manufacturers, body styles, and drive wheels.

Purpose:
-------------------
- Descriptive Analysis: Understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
- Inferential Analysis: Make inferences about factors influencing selling prices.
- Predictive Analysis: Predict selling prices based on car features.
- Insight Generation: Provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.
